    AnyDVD has been replaced with Xreveal since RedFox has seemingly disappeared. Xreveal is cheaper
    and overall better anyways. Also expanded upon a bit of the Q&A.

    Also I added a proper hero image [that's stolen lol](https://www.tweaktown.com/news/99072/sony-wont-phase-out-blu-ray-movie-and-game-discs-only-ceasing-production-on-consumer-bd/index.html)
</Note>

This guide tells you the basics of how to rip DVDs, BDs, and UHDs into a digital format (MKVs and ISOs.) 
Setting it up can be a bit complicated, but afterwards, the workflow is fairly straightforward.

## Software needed
You'll mainly need [MakeMKV.](https://www.makemkv.com/) It's currently free and in public beta (although 
you'll need to get a key for it, which can be found [on the forums](https://forum.makemkv.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=1053) 
and registered via Help -> Register. There's also an [auto-updater tool.](https://cable.ayra.ch/makemkv/)) 
If you want to make ISOs (i.e. make a basically full copy of the disc), you have two options:
1. [ImgBurn](https://www.imgburn.com/) - Free software that we'll use to turn a folder created by 
  MakeMKV into an ISO file.
2. [Xreveal](https://xreveal.com/) - Free/Paid software, but with the addition of various protection
  removals (such as region codes) and the benefit of ripping straight to ISO, cutting down on processing
  time by a significant margin.

<Note title="Ripping UHDs / 4K?">
    You will need additional software and will need to patch your USB player to support LibreDrive. 
    **Not all players are supported.** [Skip ahead to that section.](#how-do-i-setup-uhd-rips)
</Note>

## How do I make MKVs?
1. Get a USB player.
    - [Patch it if you're doing UHD.](#how-do-i-setup-uhd-rips)
2. Open up MakeMKV and insert the disc.
    - If you have AnyDVD enabled, disable it first before launching.
3. Press the disc player icon (the big one on the middle left.)
    - Alternatively, if you already ripped it to ISO, you can open the file by pressing the upper left icon. 
      This method saves an enormous amount of time when ripping both formats, especially when using an SSD, 
      as you don't have to rip directly from the disc.
4. Once it's done scanning, checkmark all the titles (videos) you want to rip.
    - General rule of thumb - the biggest file size is usually the full movie.
    - TV Shows also follow this mentality, as it's usually one long video instead of being separated.
5. Click the drive with a green arrow on it, under "Make MKV", to start ripping.
    - This will take a while, depending on the file size and disk player speed.

After this is done, your MKV file is ready! You can convert it to an MP4 or other format if you want, 
[or you can REMUX it.](https://rentry.org/bingremuxin)

## How do I make an ISO? (MakeMKV + ImgBurn)
1. Get a USB player, open up MakeMKV, and insert the disc.
    - [Patch your USB player if you're doing UHD](#how-do-i-setup-uhd-rips)
2. Press the folder icon on the top left.

![Example showing the icon](https://i.ibb.co/T1Nsg50/makemkv-t-UAFDN2-C38.png)

3. Select "Decrypt video files" if it isn't already checked.
4. Select an output folder and press OK.
    - Note the directory, you'll need it in ImgBurn.
5. Wait for it to finish ripping.
    - Generally takes around an hour if you have a 6X BD read speed, USB 3.0, and an SSD.
6. Open ImgBurn and select "Create image file from files/folders"
7. Under Source, press the icon with a folder and magnifying glass, and select the output folder from earlier.
8. In destination, select a place for the ISO file.
9. Click the calculator icon. This will add all the necessary info needed. Hit "Yes" if any prompts come up.
10. Press the folder -> ISO button on the bottom left and wait.
11. (Optional) Remove MakeMKV's output folder from before to save space.

You now have a full digital copy of your disc. This allows you to do a variety of things, such as watch with 
disc menus on VLC or make a full backup onto a physical disc (essentially making an identical copy.) As 
mentioned previously, you can also use this ISO file to get an MKV on MakeMKV.

## How do I make an ISO? (XReveal)
Note: You are **not required** to use the Pro version. It offers extra protection removal and some extra
features (like a dark theme) but it is not needed to use the software.

1. [Download and configure Xreveal](https://xreveal.com/download.html) if you haven't already.
    - The main thing you want to configure is KeyDB, which allows you to rip offline. This isn't essential,
    but it helps in the event that your internet goes out, or if the parent company mysteriously vanishes
    (*cough cough* RedFox *cough cough*.)
    - KeyDB can be downloaded here: http://fvonline-db.bplaced.net/ Scroll down until you see Downloads
    and click on English. (Unless you're doing a foreign release, in which case you *may* need a different one,
    but it's pretty rare since it should be in the English database anyways.) Just extract it and
    configure the location on Xreveal.
    - You may also want to configure the protection removals in settings, under BD & UHD.
2. Insert your disc.
    - If you have it configured, it'll ask you what region your disc is in. If you're not sure you can look it up
    on [blu-ray.com](https://blu-ray.com)
3. Right click Xreveal's taskbar icon and select "Rip to ISO", configure some stuff if needed, and start ripping:

![Example of ISO rip](https://i.ibb.co/f8gDSPq/image.png)

If you want to verify the ISO's file, you can use Xreveal's ["Content Hash Verifier".](https://www.xreveal.com/content-hash-verifier.html)
If you have the pro version, it's as simple as going into Xreveal's menu, going to Content Hash Verifier, and
pressing "Verify ISO". However on the free version, it's a little more work since you need to use a CLI version. 
The benefit is that you don't have to pay for it (and it's cross platform... despite Xreveal only being on Windows...)
but the drawback is that it requires more steps.

1. Download the verifier
2. Open up terminal
3. Change the directory to where the verifier is downloaded
    - Usually just `cd ~/Downloads`
4. Mount the ISO file
    - Right click it in explorer and press Mount
5. Find the drive that it's mounted to
6. Run the following:
    - `./contenthashverifier.exe X:\`
    - Replace X: with what drive it's in.

The instructions are somewhat similar on Mac and Linux. (Plus I expect you to know how to use the 
terminal if you're on Linux.) It's also worth noting that, unless you get any read errors during ripping,
you *should not need to verify* the disc's hash, especially right away.

## How do I setup UHD rips?
This is a non-exhaustive guide, mainly focusing on the LG Slim BU40N / Archgon UHD drive (which is the one 
I have, and at the time of writing, the cheapest.) If you have a different player, there is a chance it may not 
be supported. Please visit [this UHD drive flashing thread](https://forum.makemkv.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=19634) 
and the [SDFtool Flasher thread.](https://forum.makemkv.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=22896) It should also be noted 
that the first thread lists some sellers for pre-flashed drives, although I can not personally vouch for them.
1. Get a UHD USB player, if you don't have one already.
    - If you want a different player than the one here (LG BU40N / Archgon), there's a list of recommended drives, 
      also on the UHD flashing thread.
2. Find the model of your player and the firmware needed.
    - For LG BU40N / Archgon, you need BU40N 1.03MK, or `HL-DT-ST-BD-RE_BU40N-1.03-NM00000-211810241934.bin`
    - For any other model, see the flash thread.
3. Download the patched firmware from [this zip file.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HRnbXiM8TkwcAcvqYFR31bbJsEZ0FCdM/view) 
  Extract the one you need somewhere.
    - There's 1 or 2 not included that is listed on the threads.
4. [Download the latest version of SDFtool flasher.](https://forum.makemkv.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=22896)
5. If you have a disc inserted, eject it.
6. Open the program and select your drive from the top dropdown menu.
7. Select "WRITE" firmware and the firmware file in the bottom dropdown.
8. Hit "START" and pray.

If everything works, you should now be able to rip UHD discs, like any other disc. Try it on MakeMKV - 
it should say on the right that it's patched, under "LibreDrive information." If it doesn't, you can try 
the "RECOVER" option on SDFtool.

## Tips / Q&A
* How do you play an ISO file?

[VLC.](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) You may need to [install Java](https://adoptium.net/) for menus.

[MPV also works](https://mpv.io/) but doesn't support DVD menus. [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/) *may* work,
but from my own testing, UHDs don't work and the feature is quite buggy in general. Same with 
[PowerDVD.](https://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdvd-ultra/features_en_US.html?r=1)

Also [MPC-HC](https://mpc-hc.org/) should work, but requires you to mount the ISO and its
no longer actively developed.

* Why suggest Xreveal, a partially paid and uncracked software, for piracy?

As far as I know, it is the cheapest and currently the best software for disc ripping
that also includes region code removal (on top of some other things.) For scene rules, 
[this is required for COMPLETE BLURAY releases,](https://scenerules.org/html/2014_BLURAY.html) under G3. 
It also greatly shortens the amount of time needed to rip ISOs while making the process more direct. 

Is it a bit pricey? Yes. Is it worth it? That depends on you, and if you're going to be doing continuous releases, 
then you might want to consider it.

* What about DVDFab?

Some people swear by it, but simply put, ***it is way too expensive.*** You can find cracks of it online,
but from my experience they don't work that well. Just save yourself the $250 and use MakeMKV. (Even
Xreveal is $45 for lifetime, and AnyDVD was only about $80.)

* What about Leawo?

Complete garbage. Simple as that.

* What about CloneBD? EaseFab? etc.

If you like using a certain type of software, then feel free to use it. In fact I'm more than happy
to list other software if it's better than what's on here. (This guide previously recommended AnyDVD before it
became defunct.) These are just easiest ones to get into and, most importantly, are completely free
(or relatively cheap in terms of Xreveal.)

* On MakeMKV, it's failing a hash check! / On Xreveal, I'm getting read errors!

Your disc is most likely dirty. Clean it with warm water and dry with microfiber towels. You may also want to 
clean your player.

* It's still having problems after cleaning!

Clean and clean again. If that doesn't work, you'll probably want to return it. Unfortunately, this is the 
downside of doing full copies of discs, as without that bit of data that it can't read, you can't make a complete 
copy. Not to mention that most players (like the Archgon player in the UHD guide) have a feature that skips over 
any data it can't read, meaning you won't be able to do ddrescue (not that you can use it since retail discs are 
encrypted.)

* What's the best place to get discs?

Amazon has basically everything, especially newer releases. [Blu-ray.com](https://www.blu-ray.com) is a great 
database for BD and UHD discs, and on each entry, there's an Amazon link. (It also has some DVDs but it's not as 
extensive.) You can also try eBay, but obviously be wary of its condition. As for physical retailers, Walmart sells 
BDs (sometimes even UHDs.) Barnes & Nobles also sell them, but don't expect anything huge from them.
There are plenty of other stores that sell them and you'll need to look at your local areas. There are also the 
questionable sellers, such as craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, and the occasional yard sale. I obviously cannot 
recommend them, but they do exist. Ask the seller first if you can inspect the disc before buying (bonus points 
if they let you test it.) And of course, for any of these stores / sellers, try to get a refund / return if the 
disc doesn't work.

You may also want to try rental services. If you're in the US (which good luck if you're doing releases!) the 
biggest service still around is redbox (which even has UHDs in some cities.) There's also [this different service 
called "3D BluRay Rental"](https://www.store-3d-blurayrental.com/default.asp) that specializes in 3D and UHDs. 
(And honestly, a service I haven't even heard about before researching for this guide.) I can't personally vouch 
for either of these, but they're good if you just need to rip the disc, won't plan on keeping it, and are short 
on money.

* I have another question not answered here.

If it's related to MakeMKV, [you can ask on their forums.](https://forum.makemkv.com/forum/) If it's related to 
Xreveal, [you can either ask their support or their weird "forum" thing.](https://www.xreveal.com/support.html) 
These two have very helpful members, although you shouldn't mention that you're using it for piracy. Obviously. 
You can also try asking on [c/piracy.](https://lemmy.dbzer0.com/c/piracy)
